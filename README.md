# This project is Called IOA, simply to mean All In One Applications.

There are more than 4 different features in this project. Though they can be small in size.
Keep in mind that they can and will be improved up on. Over the time, I will personally spend much time improving this craft.
If you are a developer like me and feel like contributing to this project. Feel free to fork it and make a pull request, I guarantee you that the changes you will make will be merged to this repository (Kinda like a open source project, LOL).

This will help me get much traffic on my account and attract future employers. Thanks for doing that.

### Though it might seem like this project is mediocre, It helped me learn different concepts in REACT.JS

## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I learned how to make different routes in a react.js project, learned how to use different Hooks like useState, useEffect and useContext not to mention useMemo hook. It also gave a sneak peak around how to think in react and to a SPA(Single Page App). Which is a new concept for to be quite frank.
This was small and mediocre but it really gave a great experience and looking forward to make other changes on this and make it more better in the future.

## ðŸ›  Skills

React.js, Vanilla CSS in React.js and react-router-dom package.

# Getting Started with This Project

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file, Just kidding LOL. You don't need to add anything to get started using this project

## Installation

Once you have cloned or downloaded a zip file for this project, you will have to install all the packages used to make this project. Like react-router-dom, bootstrap and others.

Just run this command in your CMD. npm install.
It will probably take a while to install all the needed packages, but don't just give up yet. When everything is done. You can just start using the project by running 'npm start' if you are a developer like; or 'npm build' for building a deployable version that can be tested.

Anyway, I am talking too much let's get started !!!!!!

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
But if you have another app running on this port, you can spin it to run on different port too.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console. Just ignore those.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, A little bit of Bootstrap and Much vanilla CSS.

**Server:** There is no server used in this project. But there is a localy made data.json file that served a source of data.
